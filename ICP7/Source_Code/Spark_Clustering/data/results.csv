7,lights, also known as traffic signals, traffic lamps, traffic semaphore, signal lights, stop lights, robots (in South Africa and most of Africa), and traffic control signals (in technical parlance),[1] are signalling devices positioned at road intersections, pedestrian crossings, and other locations to control flows of traffic.
5,world's first traffic light was short lived. It was a manually operated gas-lit signal installed in London in December 1868. It exploded less than a month after it was implemented, injuring its policeman operator.[2] Traffic control started to seem necessary in the late 1890s and Earnest Sirrine from Chicago patented the first automated traffic control system in 1910. It used the words "STOP" and "PROCEED", although neither word lit up.[3]
9,lights alternate the right of way accorded to users by illuminating lamps or LEDs of standard colours (red, amber (yellow), and green) following a universal colour code. In the typical sequence of colour phases:
5,green light allows traffic to proceed in the direction denoted, if it is safe to do so and there is room on the other side of the intersection.
2,amber light warns that the signal is about to change to red. In a number of countries – among them the United Kingdom – a phase during which red and yellow are displayed together indicates that the signal is about to change to green.[4] Actions required by drivers on a yellow light vary, with some jurisdictions requiring drivers to stop if it is safe to do so, and others allowing drivers to go through the intersection if safe to do so.
1,flashing amber indication is a warning signal. In the United Kingdom, a flashing amber light is used only at pelican crossings, in place of the combined red–amber signal, and indicates that drivers may pass if no pedestrians are on the crossing.
6,red signal prohibits any traffic from proceeding.
6,flashing red indication is treated as a stop sign.
4,some countries traffic signals will go into a flashing mode if the conflict monitor detects a problem, such as a fault that tries to display green lights to conflicting traffic. The signal may display flashing yellow to the main road and flashing red to the side road, or flashing red in all directions. Flashing operation can also be used during times of day when traffic is light, such as late at night.
7,first recognizably modern electric traffic light was invented in 1912 by Lester Wire, a Utah law school dropout turned policeman. Wire’s two-color traffic light, placed at the intersection of 200 South and Main Street in Salt Lake City, looked like a birdhouse with lights placed in it.
8,traffic control is an old, old idea. There are records that three men worked as traffic police at London Bridge in the 1720s to make sure that the traffic traveling across the River Thames rode on the left. Generally speaking, however, such measures were unusual. In past centuries, the fastest available transportation was the horse, and population densities were low. (Before 1900, over half of all Americans lived in rural areas!).
3,transportation in the 19th century led to the development of lighted signals that could be seen from a moving vehicle at the then-unprecedented speed of 30 miles per hour. Electricity was uncommon at this point, so many railway signals used gas lamps to control train movements.

0,1868, in London, a modified version of one of these gas lamp signals was built to control traffic. Railway engineer John Peake Knight designed it. The signal was built outside Parliament to regulate traffic over the Westminster Bridge. The traffic signal was derived from a railway semaphore signal and was manually operated by the policeman who ordinarily controlled traffic. The experiment was initially a success, but after a few weeks Knight’s traffic light exploded, injuring the policeman who operated it. After the accident, the experiment was cancelled.
